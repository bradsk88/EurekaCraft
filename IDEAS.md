## Advancements

Find A Broken Ref Board
- Build a Reflection Film Scraper
  - Craft a Reflection Film Mold
    - Craft a Reflection Film
      - Build a Ref Board
        - Lift on TRAPAR waves
          - Lift above Y=N
          - Lift further than N
          - Cut back drop turn
- Find or Craft Fresh Seeds
  - Harvest SkyFish Skin (Can be smelted into reflection film)
- Obtain scub coral
  - Build TRAPAR infuser
    - Craft TRAPAR goggles
    - Infuse ref-boarding shoes (feather falling when off board)
- Craft Goggles


## Other Ideas
- Loot from ref boarding shacks
- Locked box
  - Can only be opened with reflective key (wood around reflection film)
    - Loots: Keys, Wheels, Film, Goggles 
- Ray//Out: Magizines unlock things?
  - Patterns? Upgrade kits
- Special crafting table (multi-block structure of 2 blocks)
  - 2x3 grid for materials
  - Additional slot for blueprints/skins/etc
  - Coal slot for melting reflective film
  - Tool slot for sandpaper/etc (increase speed, etc)
- Ref boards age and eventually become unusable
  - Armor-stand style item for old boards (still cosmetically cool)
- Ref board "wheels" increase agility/maneuverability
  - Follow standard minecraft tiers: wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, etc.
    - Better material == better cornering
    - Maybe other benefits for other materials (slime?)
- Trapar storm 
  - Copy minecraft rain. Turn it green, maybe have it flow upward?
  - Positive lift without trapar blocks
- Additional ref board "cores" can be discovered in shacks or magazines
  - Eg: Jumper (lots of lift but low speed/manueverability)
  - Eg: Speeder (lots of speed but low control)

## Crafting Table Recipes

### Sticky Disc
```
CPC
PCP
CPC
```

C = Clay
P = Paper

### Flint Sticky Disc
```
FCF
CFC
FCF
```

(Cook in furnace to create Flint Sanding Disc)
(Could also do quartz, diamond, etc. - better luck for Ref Table)

### Trapar Chest Key
```
WWW
WFW
WWW
```

W = Wood
F = Reflective Film (scraped from old ref boards)

(Wears quickly, maybe 3 uses)

### Quality Reflection Film
```
RRR
RFD
RRR
```
R = Redstone
F = Reflective Film
D = Diamond

### ~Scraper Recipes~

Scratch this.  Sandpaper on the ref table with a secondary output is better.

> Insert Old board - Get Reflection Film
> Insert Wood (wood slab?) - Get Precision Board Wood
> 
> - These recipes shoud probably take some kind of fuel or maybe abrasive
> - Craft a custom (eurekacraft specific) abrasive block that improves outcome
> - Random chance of failed result? Better machine iterations to improve chances?

## Ref Table Recipes

### Precision Board Wood + Reflection Film Dust
```
X--
--- - S
---
```

X = Ref Board Pieces
S = Sandpaper

Always get precision board wood, random chance for dust

Maybe require fuel? Doesn't really make sense.
Still take time to "cook".  Play "sand" sound?

### Glide Board (No positive lift)
(Basically a hang glider)

```
WW
WW - C (works like furnace with slow application process)
WW
```

W = Wood Block (Maybe wood slab)
C = Coal (special slot)

### Heavy Ref Board Core (No positive lift - heavy weight)
```
WWI
WWS - B - C
WWI
```

S = stick
I = iron
B = blueprint (found in shacks and magazines)

### Ref Board Core (No positive lift - standard weight)
```
ZZI
ZZS - B - C
ZZI
```

Z = Precision Board Wood

### Ref Board (Some lift)
```
FFF
FFF - R - C 
FFF
```

R = Ref Board Core

(Random outcome for lift score)

### Elite Ref Board (more lift)
```
QQQ
QQQ - R - C 
QQQ
```

Q = Quality Reflection Film

### Any Board Dyed
```
DDD
DDD - R - C
DDD
```

D = dye 
R = Board
C = Coal (works like furnace with slow application process)
